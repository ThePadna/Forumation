Currently there is only an installer for Windows [Forumation-Installer](https://github.com/ThePadna/Forumation-Installer) which runs on NodeJS.
### How do I run php-cgi daemon?
Head to the directory where you installed php, execute `php-cgi.exe -b 127.0.0.1:9000`. Feel free to use a different port, but you must modify `Nginx.conf`.
